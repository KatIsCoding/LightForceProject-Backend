# LightForceArcade-Backend

LightForceArcade is a coding excercise submission that was part of my job application process for a position at LightForce. The goal was to create a simple fullstack web application that would allow users do multiple actions such as playing a game, buying and using tickets. It features some other features such as a leaderboard and a ledge.
